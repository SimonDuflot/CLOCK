# CLOCK

We all need to know the time. But looking at the right of our taskbar is such a hassle.

This is why I decided to tackle head on this problem humanity is facing.

Star this repo, and everytime you need to look at the time: get on your computer, do NOT look at your taskbar, login to your github account, clone the repo, and use a live server to access the most precious ressource we humans have.

Do not thank me. Thank yourself for being a productive chad.
